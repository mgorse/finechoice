FineChoice
==========

FineChoice is intended to facilitate the process of collecting input from
a large group of individuals in order to formulate a budget. An administrator
can create a survey listing a number of proposed items, and users taking the
survey will indicate the choices that they would prefer be made. Each item
will be scored based on its cost and the number of users that select it, and
a budget will be proposed by the site with the goal of maximizing the total
score and, in doing so, tabulating the input of the users who take the survey.
