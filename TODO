survey.php should check  items already selected (ie, make it easier to edit
  selections).

survey.php should have a script to tally the amount of money spent / let the
  user know what is left after items are checked and unchecked.

Can't edit or close a budget; only create new ones.
Would be nice to be able to add more than 10 items/emails at a time.

Need to be able to email invitations with codes.

Add groups of users. An admin should be able to add or edit a group and
automatically invite people in that group to complete a budget survey.

Users need to be able to change their password.

Users need to be able to recover their password.

Figure out how best to score budgets (is there an existing module that could
be plugged in?)

Testing of some kind would be desirable.

Should users be allowed to add their own items?

comments.php doesn't filter the user's comment in any way, meaning that, among
  other things, users can enter any kind of html/script that they want. This is
  a big problem.
