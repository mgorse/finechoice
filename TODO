index.php should list the surveys which a user has been invited to complete,
allow a user to create a budget.

Implement page for a participant to complete and edit a survey.

Add a page for an admin to edit a budget.

Add groups of users. An admin should be able to add or edit a group and
automatically invite people in that group to complete a budget survey.

Figure out how best to score budgets (is there an existing module that could
be plugged in?)

Testing of some kind would be desirable.

Should users be allowed to add their own items?
